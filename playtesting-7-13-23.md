# Notes from 7 / 13 / 23

The first combat against the CRINGELORD went well.
The Warrior died and revived with the strength buff after.
We bought another Warrior with the money.
However, the second combat with two THIEF enemies was too hard.
We lost and only killed one of the two THIEF enemies.

The only two companions that we have enabled so far are the
1. Warrior
2. Entropy
For the rest of my time today, going to implement the companions.

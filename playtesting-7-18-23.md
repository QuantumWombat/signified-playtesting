Feature notes:

Features:
* click on buttons??? it has enough fidelity maybe
* interest
* Include card details in the shop:
* description
* which companion they belong to

Ethan feedback on the prototyping:
* there needs to be things that want to take damage rather than dying.
* one lane works really well
* hitting the front or the back makes the placement decisions more interesting.
* buying companions just for meat packs feels bad man.
* name the guys shorter names so you have to type less.
* No interplay between the guys
* Much better foundation to add complexity.
